# About
The Python codes for Lasthrim Projection' Partial Differential Equation (PDE) chapter.

#### Warning: The codes are for learning purpose, there is no guarantee that they are all correct 100%, there are some human errors and will still be revisited for revision and correction.

## Modules for Partial Differential Equations (13 October 2023)

```
matplotlib
numpy
sympy
sympy_plot_backends
```

# Setup
(Assuming you are using LinuxOS or GFreya OS, you will already have Python installed)

1. First create an empty directory, I name it "Python-PDE", create the Python file or copy file from this repo, then inside the directory open terminal and type

```
python3 ch2-pde-heatequation1dplot.py
```
