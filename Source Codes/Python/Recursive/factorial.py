# If you want to calculate the factorial of 1,001, 
# the recursive factorial() function must make 1,001 recursive function calls. 
# However, your program is likely to cause a stack overflow before it can finish, 
# because making so many function calls without returning would exceed 
# the maximum call stack size of the interpreter. 
# This is terrible; you would never want to use a 
# recursive factorial function in real-world code.
